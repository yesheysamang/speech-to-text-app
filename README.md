# speech-to-text-app

Real-time Speech to Text Conversion with sound localization capabilities. The system will transcribe audio into written text for the Deaf / hearing impaired, while pin-pointing the location of the incoming sound/voice. See video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCEXXUiLlDM).

# What I learned/did 
* Implemented sound localization to a real-time audio stream, which is captured via microphone array and transcribed through Googleâ€™s Cloud Speech-to-Text API
* Developed a Graphical User Interface that displays transcribed audio as well as sound location using a Python GUI toolkit (tkinter)
